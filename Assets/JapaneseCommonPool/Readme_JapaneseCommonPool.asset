    text: The pack of JapaneseCommonRoom includes 38 prefabs. Most of the models are
      composed of 1,000 - 5,000 verts and 1k texture(color and metallic).The watersurface has the original shader which was made in shader graph. It, however, is so brief that I recommend you to find high-end shader in asset store.
